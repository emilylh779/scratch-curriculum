Introduction: In this project we are going to make a game similar to the classic game 

Frogger, your character will jump onto a series of logs to win. 

Step 1 : Create your character

1. Start a new project

2. Import / draw your own background. This will be the background which your 

character will fall into if they miss the log. 

3. First delete the Scratch cat , and import / draw a character . 

Step 2: Draw 6 rectangles, these will be the ‘logs’ which your character will be hopping on. 

You could make one and duplicate the rectangle.

Step 3: Draw a background, this could be a water background like the classic Frogger 

games, or you use your own ideas like your character is avoiding lava in a volcano. 

Step 4 : Time to start programming! On your character sprite use this coding to make the 

character move, this script will make the character move to the left when the left arrow key is 

clicked. 

When [left arrow v] key pressed 

Change x by (-10)

Use this code to make the sprite move to the right:
