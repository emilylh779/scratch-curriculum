Code Club : How to make a river crossing game project By

Emily Harding 

Introduction: In this project we are going to make a game similar to the classic game 

Frogger, your character will jump onto a series of logs to win. 

Step 1 : Create your character and logs

1. Start a new project

2.  First delete elete the Scratch cat , and import / draw a character .  

3.  Import / draw your own background. This will be the background which your 
    character will fall into if they miss the log. 

4. Draw 6 rectangles, these will be the ‘logs’ which your character will be hopping on. 
   Make one log then duplicate the rectangle's 5 times. 
 

Step 3: Draw a background, this could be a water background like the classic Frogger 

games, or you use your own ideas like your character is avoiding lava in a volcano. 

Step 4 : Time to start programming! On your character sprite use this coding to make the 

character move, this script will make the character move to the left when the left arrow key is 

clicked. 

When [left arrow v] key pressed 
Change x by (-10)

Use this code to make the sprite move to the right: 

When [right arrow v] key pressed 
Change x by (10)
